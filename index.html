							<h2>Welcome!<br />
						</header>
						<p class="bio">Hello! I am Brian Krentz, a junior at Harvard University studying Electrical Engineering. I am primarily interested in studying computer hardware, robotics, and startups. Most recently, I worked in a summer research program with Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and HKUST to design an unmanned aerial vehicle to be able to deliver objects.</p>
						<p class="bio">Apart from academics, I spent many years as a figure skater, representing Team USA in the 2013 Junior Grand Prix series and competing several times at USFS National Championships. I am currently a captain for the Harvard Men's Frisbee B-team (BRed Line) and have played for the team the past two years.</p>

								<h3>Delivery Quadcopter</h3>
								<p>This project was done through the Harvard-HKUST Summer Research Experience in a group of 8 undergraduates. We built a quadcopter that can perform deliveries to open spaces with the simple use of an app interface to give the delivery address and control the quadcopter. A customer can place an order on the app, and the vendor can then use the app to send out the drone on its delivery routine. Once given an address, the latitude and longitude are found. The autopilot then generates waypoints to take it to the destination, carrying the package with a gripper. When it arrives, it lowers the package safely to the ground before returning to its home destination for another delivery. My personal contributions to the project were for the control and hardware aspects. Click <a HREF="files/UAVReport.pdf">HERE</a> for a detailed report.</p>

								<h3>Sleep Tracking Smartwatch</h3>
								<p>This is a design for a printed circuit board (built with EAGLE) that can be used for a smartwatch. Two others and I built this design for a course in embedded electronics. Our design combines an accelerometer and a heart rate sensor to track the duration and quality of sleep of the user by measuring the amount of movement the user has during the night. It uses an e-ink display to display a digital watch, graphs, and sleep data. For an average amount of use, the watch should be able to work for ~48 hours before needing to be recharged.</p>

								<h3>Inductive Door Opener</h3>
								<p>Worked in a group of two to create a device that could unlock a door after having a correct passcode being “knocked” in. This project utilized a magnetic coil as a near field communication device. A piezoelectric sensor generated voltages (from knocking on the door) that were sent through the coil after being passed through an amplitude modulation phase to maximize the signal strength. A Hall effect sensor acted as a receiver for the signal. The signal was then demodulated with an envelope detector before it was sent to a microcontroller, which analyzed the code and unlocked the door (by activating a servo). Both my project partner and I had an equal contibution in all aspects of the project.</p>

								<h3>Conway's Game of Life Music Stream</h3>
								<p>I worked in a group of three to construct Conway’s Game of Life and turned the resulting matrix into a music stream (each row a note, each column a beat) that could be fed into a genetic algorithm. This was coded in OCaml and output the music to MIDI files. After the initial music files for random configurations of Conway's Game of Life were generated, a genetic algorithm (using user feedback for the fitness function) was applied to the music stream in order to try and create a more enjoyable music stream.</p>

								<h3>Medical Tricorder</h3>
								<p>This project was constructed to bring together all the medical-sensing technologies an EMT might need when they get to an emergency scene and need to take measurements quickly. One of my project partners, who was training to be an EMT, determined that the most important measurements are heart-rate, blood oxygenation, temperature, and an EKG. We built our own EKG, hacked a heart-rate monitor/blood-oxygenation sensor, and used a temperature sensor. All of these inputs fed into an Arduino, which would analyze and print to a thermal printer.</p>
