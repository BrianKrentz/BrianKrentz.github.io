									<p>Hello, I am a senior at Harvard University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am passionate about using technology to create innovative solutions around today’s problems. My career interests are in product design and product management.</p> <br><br>
									<p>
									In my free time I enjoy many athletic hobbies. I spent many years as a competitive figure skater, representing Team USA in 2013. I am currently a captain for the Harvard Men’s Frisbee team and have played for the team for the past three years. In addition to this, I am also president of Harvard Krav Maga – an Israeli style of self-defense.

												<h4>HCL Detection Instrument</h4>
												<p>This was a semester long team project done in conjunction with the Anderson Group at Harvard Univsersity. Large convective storms in the central US are able to bring particles past the troposphere into the stratosphere, which could have devastating consequences for the ozone layer. The goal of the project was to prototype an ICOS instrument for HCL detection in the lower stratosphere; so further modeling could be done for ozone health. The concentration of HCL in the stratosphere is between 10-80 parts per trillion (ppt), so our prototype was built to have a detection of 50ppt. My contributions to the project were focused on developing a laser driver to produce the necessary waveforms with incredibly precise timing. This included creating a schematic, turning the schematic into a PCB, and testing each component to verify its specifications and performance in my circuit.  </p>

												<h4>Senior Design Project</h4>
												<p>A year long project, undertaken in the senior year as a thesis. This project fully explores the design process through development of multiple iterations of prototypes. I am developing an input device for augmented reality applications.</p>

												<h4>Quadcopter Research</h4>
												<p>This project was done through the Harvard-HKUST Summer Research Experience in a group of 8 undergraduates. We built a quadcopter that can perform deliveries to open spaces with the simple use of an app interface to give the delivery address and control the quadcopter. A customer can place an order on the app, and the vendor can then use the app to send out the drone on its delivery routine. Once given an address, the latitude and longitude are found. The autopilot then generates waypoints to take it to the destination, carrying the package with a gripper. When it arrives, it lowers the package safely to the ground before returning to its home destination for another delivery. My personal contributions to the project were for the control and hardware aspects. Click <a href="">Here</a> for a detailed report.</p>

												<h4>Sleeptracking smartwatch</h4>
												<p>This is a design for a printed circuit board (built with EAGLE) that can be used for a smartwatch. Two others and I built this design for a course in embedded electronics. Our design combines an accelerometer and a heart rate sensor to track the duration and quality of sleep of the user by measuring the amount of movement the user has during the night. It uses an e-ink display to display a digital watch, graphs, and sleep data. For an average amount of use, the watch should be able to work for ~48 hours before needing to be recharged.</p>
