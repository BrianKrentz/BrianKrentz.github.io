									<p>Hello! I am a senior at Harvard University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Engineering became a large passion of mine because I enjoy searching for out-of-the-box and innovative technical solutions for today's problems. My other passion is entrepreneurship. I am excited by the technical and business challenges of moving from an idea to a prototype, and turning a prototype into a scalable business. 
									</p>
									<p>
									In my free time I enjoy many athletic hobbies. For many years, I was a competitive figure skater and in 2013 I represented Team USA. I am currently a captain for the Harvard Men’s Frisbee team and have played for the team for the past three years. In addition, I am president of Harvard Krav Maga – an Israeli style of self-defense.

												<h4>HCL Detection Instrument</h4>
												<p>This was a semester long team project done in conjunction with the Anderson Group at Harvard Univsersity. Large convective storms in the central US are able to bring particles past the troposphere into the stratosphere, which could have devastating consequences for the ozone layer. The goal of the project was to prototype an ICOS instrument for HCL detection in the lower stratosphere; so further modeling could be done for ozone health. The concentration of HCL in the stratosphere is between 10-80 parts per trillion (ppt), so our prototype was built to have a detection of 50ppt. My contributions to the project were focused on developing a laser driver to produce the necessary waveforms with incredibly precise timing. This included creating a schematic, turning the schematic into a PCB, and testing each component to verify its specifications and performance in my circuit. Click <a href="Final Presentation.pdf">Here</a> for a full summary of the project.</p>

												<h4>Senior Design Project</h4>
												<p>A year long project, undertaken in the senior year as a thesis. This project fully explores the design process through development of multiple iterations of prototypes. I am developing an input device for augmented reality applications.</p>

												<h4>Quadcopter Research</h4>
												<p>This project was done through the Harvard-HKUST Summer Research Experience in a group of 8 undergraduates. We built a quadcopter that can perform deliveries to open spaces with the simple use of an app interface to give the delivery address and control the quadcopter. Our design was based off of user research data we gathered from surveys, interviews, and market research. For our final prototype, a customer could place an order on the app, and the vendor could then use the app to send out the drone on its delivery routine. Once given an address, the latitude and longitude are found. The autopilot generates waypoints to take it to the destination, carrying the package with a gripper. When it arrives, it lowers the package safely to the ground before returning to its home destination for another delivery. My personal contributions to the project were focused on the autopilot and hardware. Click <a href="UAVReport.pdf">Here</a> for a detailed report.</p>

												<h4>Sleeptracking smartwatch</h4>
												<p>This is a design for a printed circuit board (built with EAGLE) that can be used for a smartwatch. Two others and I built this design for a course in embedded electronics. Our design combines an accelerometer and a heart rate sensor to track the duration and quality of sleep of the user by measuring the amount of movement the user has during the night. It uses an e-ink display to display a digital watch, graphs, and sleep data. For an average amount of use, the watch should be able to work for ~48 hours before needing to be recharged.</p>

												<h4>Inductive Door Opener</h4>
												<p>This project was done to explore Near Field Communication devices and create my own from scratch. The goal was to create a device that could unlock a door after having a correct passcode being “knocked” in. This project utilized a magnetic coil as a near field communication device. A piezoelectric sensor generated voltages (from knocking on the door) that were sent through the coil after being passed through an amplitude modulation phase to maximize the signal strength. A Hall effect sensor acted as a receiver for the signal. The signal was then demodulated with an envelope detector before it was sent to a microcontroller, which analyzed the code and unlocked the door (by activating a servo). Both my project partner and I had an equal contibution in all aspects of the project.</p>

												<h4>Medical Tricorder</h4>
												<p>This project was my first foray into engineering. Myself and two others constructed a device to bring together all the medical-sensing technologies an EMT might need when they get to an emergency scene and need to take measurements quickly. One of my project partners, who was training to be an EMT, determined that the most important measurements are heart-rate, blood oxygenation, temperature, and an EKG. We built our own EKG, hacked a heart-rate monitor/blood-oxygenation sensor, and used a temperature sensor. All of these inputs fed into an Arduino, which would analyze and print to a thermal printer.</p>
